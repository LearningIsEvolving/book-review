# Book Review #

DEPRECATION NOTICE: Given the imminent release of the Gutenberg editor in WordPress 5.0, the Book Review plugin is no longer being maintained. It has been replaced by [Book Review Block](https://github.com/donnapep/book-review-block), which is intended to be used together with Gutenberg.

## Review More Than Just Books ##
One of the most powerful features of Book Review is the ability to add custom fields to each of your reviews. Custom fields enable you to review movies, music, TV shows and so much more!

## Save Time ##
Book Review saves you time when writing your reviews. No more copying and pasting or manually entering the details of a book. Instead, you provide the ISBN, and Book Review will automatically populate information like title, author, and even the cover photo for you.

## Increase Traffic ##
Book Review can help increase traffic to your site by making your Google search result stand out from the rest. And that means more users clicking through to visit your site.

See the *Screenshots* below for an example of what your Google search result might look like.

## Monetize Your Site ##
If you’re interested in throwing monetization into the mix, Book Review can help with its custom links feature. Just enter the affiliate URLs for Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or any other online store, and Book Review will take care of adding the links to each of your reviews.

## Affiliate Linkalizer for Amazon ##
Although Amazon can be a great way to monetize your reviews, there’s a problem – being a member of the Amazon Associates Program in a particular country does *not* mean that you will automatically earn a commission on purchases made by users residing in other countries. And that can add up to a lot of lost revenue!

Affiliate Linkalizer for Amazon is a premium extension for Book Review that ensures you maximize your earnings by regaining that lost income.
